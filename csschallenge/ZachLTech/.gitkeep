The code for ZachLTechs 1st submission won the CSS challenge and can now be found in the root directory of this repository.

Zach:

- Soon there should be more code here as I'm rewriting the site to fit the second CSS challenge!
- Feel free to use my hand drawn Illuminate SVG as you like in your website since the logos PNG isn't very high quality. You can find it here: https://github.com/ZachLTech/hackathon-site-revamp/tree/main/assets/static/Illuminate.svg
