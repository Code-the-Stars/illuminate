Illuminate is a virtual hackathon taking place on June 7th to June 9th for high-schoolers!
# How To Work on the CSS
We want the community to work on the CSS to show what they know! All you have to do is make a branch, code on the style.css page (Don't change or delete any code that exists), and once you are finished, make a pull request! If the code looks good, it will get approved and become a part of the website and you will be added to our credits list!
