# [Illuminate](https://illuminatehackathon.org/)
A virtual hackathon that took place on June 7th to June 9th for high-schoolers! This repo is preserved as a short documentary to remember our first hackathon!

## Pre-Hackathon
Code the Stars introduced a fun optional activity before the hackathon started called the CSS challenge. We made a website with no CSS, and we challenged participants to add and improve our website! The winner who had the best-looking website was @ZachLTech! 
## Discord
Our hackathon used Discord as our method of communication. It was a great way to communicate with participants, until the server got raided (but that's another story).
