Illuminate is a virtual hackathon taking place on June 7th to June 9th for high-schoolers!

## How To Work on the CSS
We want the community to work on the CSS to show what they know! All you have to do is fork our repository (or make a branch), code on the style.css page (Don't change or delete any code that exists), and make a pull request! If the code looks good, it will get approved and become a part of the website and you will be added to our credits list! 
### How the Turns have Tabled
This website will keep getting new pages with atrocious css. Its up to YOU to make it look how you want it to look! This is a mini-competition. The person who makes our website look the coolest will get a little prize, courtesy of Code the Stars. Keep checking to see if there's a new page, or press watch on the top of the page. The results will be announced in the opening ceremony!
